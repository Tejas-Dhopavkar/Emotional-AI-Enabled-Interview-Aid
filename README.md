# Emotional-AI-Enabled-Interview-Aid
This repository contains the code for the final year project created as a requirement for B.E Computer Engineering

One of the important stages in the life of a student is his or her first job. Naturally, a candidate will
be quite nervous during an interview as it is a completely new experience. Due to such nervousness,
a candidate might be able to speak properly or may not be able to project his/her emotions correctly.
This can have a negative impact on the result of the interview. To avoid this, prior practice is
required. In order to make the candidate become more confident, we propose Emotional AI Enables
Interview Aid, so that a candidate can practice some commonly asked interview questions and
receive concrete feedback based on the response submitted. This will help a candidate become a best
fit for the company.
